# 🦄 Uniswap V4 Limit Orders Hook

> Gas-efficient limit orders natively integrated into Uniswap V4 pools

## 🎯 Problem
Uniswap V4 doesn't have native limit orders. Traders use external contracts (1inch, CoW Protocol) which fragment liquidity and increase gas costs.

## 🚀 Solution
A production-ready Uniswap V4 hook that:
- ✅ **Automated execution**: Orders fill when price hits target (afterSwap hook)
- ✅ **Gas-optimized**: "Slots of Buckets" algorithm for O(1) complexity
- ✅ **Secure**: ReentrancyGuard, TWAP validation, rate limiting
- ✅ **0.05% fee**: Sustainable revenue model

## 📊 Target Metrics
- **Launch**: Q2 2026 (Arbitrum → Optimism → Ethereum)
- **Revenue**: $50k-$500k/month
- **Users**: 1000+ by EOY 2026
- **TVL**: $100M+ by Q4 2026

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Solidity 0.8.26+ (Cancun EVM)
- Foundry (Forge, Anvil, Cast)
- Uniswap V4 Core + Periphery
- OpenZeppelin Contracts

## 📁 Project Status
- ✅ **Design Phase Complete** (Jan 20, 2026)
- 🔧 **Development Phase**: Week 1 (Setup complete)
- 📝 Next: Implement LimitOrderHook.sol contract
